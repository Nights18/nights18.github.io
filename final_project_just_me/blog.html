    <p>Have you ever been out with that friend that loves to takes selfies at random times including you in the photo leaving you wondering why... Well I must say that I for one haven't which might meant mean I am <strong>THAT</strong> friend.  Well... yep, guilty as charged. I love randomly taking pictures for no reason what so ever. Capturing a monunment unplanned and in an innocent space of time can be really magical at times. At least for you and yet annoying for your friends at the same time. Oh well, its a good things they love me... Anyway, check out some my my selfies with friends and let me know what you think. If you have ramdom photos, share them below and comment. Enjoy!<p>
